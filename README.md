# issue-tracker-MERN
My first project built using the MERN stack - Mongo, Express, React, and Node. The app helps you keep track of your ongoing projects, as well as adding participants to those projects and assign them issues.

## clone my project
```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/dyannd/issue-tracker-MERN.git

```
##env variables

```terminal
$ process.env.MONGOURI="your mongoDB url here"
$ process.env.SECRETAUTHKEY="your secret key 1 here"
$ process.env.SECRETREFRESHKEY="your secret key 2 here"
```
